How the render method works:
	 - The very first frame is completly drawed.
	 
	 - Every frame beyond the first frame gets only updated if its necessary:
		It's necessary if:
			- The mouse hovers over it
			- The obect moved
			- The object changed
			- The object appeared/disappeared.
			
	 - Click handling is based on coordinates and sizes of objects.
		Example:
			- mouse position 500,400 | object position 450,350 size 100,100 > mouse is above object.
			- mouse position 100,200 | object position 450,350 size 100,100 > mouse is not above object.
			
	 
		
How the 'game-physics' works:
	 - The game is fps/tick limited
		- 1 frame equals 1 tick
		- the game's 'physics engine' is based on ticks and is not running on a seperate thread.
		- 'physics' get calculated before the associated frame is renderd.
