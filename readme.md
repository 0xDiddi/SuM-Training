# SuM Training

Although I absolutely hate this so-called "framework", most schools aroung here seems to force students to use it for their first project, which has luckily always been the same since forever. Because most of those students barely know what they are doing, I have been asked multiple times now to do such a project for them. As a challenge (or torture), me and my friend created a well documented sample solution.
